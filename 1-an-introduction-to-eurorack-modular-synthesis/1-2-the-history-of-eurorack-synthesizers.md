| 1 | 1995 | **Birth of Eurorack:** Dieter Doepfer, a German engineer, introduces the Eurorack modular synthesizer format with the A-100 system. This new format uses a standardized size (3U) and power specifications, making it affordable and compact compared to earlier modular systems. |
| 2 | Late 1990s | **Initial Adoption:** Early adopters in Europe begin exploring Eurorack systems, attracted by the modular flexibility and affordability compared to larger, more expensive formats like Moog or Buchla. |
| 3 | Early 2000s | **Slow but Steady Growth:** Eurorack remains a niche market, with Doepfer as the primary manufacturer. Small boutique companies begin to emerge, offering unique and experimental modules. |
| 4 | 2005 | **Diverse Module Development:** Manufacturers like Analogue Systems and Analogue Solutions start producing Eurorack modules, adding variety to the ecosystem. The appeal of modular synthesis begins to spread beyond Europe. |
| 5 | 2009 | **Explosive Growth:** The modular synthesis scene starts gaining momentum in the U.S. Companies like Make Noise and Tiptop Audio enter the market, bringing innovative designs and expanding the creative possibilities of Eurorack. |
| 6 | 2010 | **Renaissance of Modular Synthesis:** The global interest in modular synthesis surges, driven by new manufacturers and increased accessibility. Eurorack systems start to appear more frequently in electronic music production and live performances. |
| 7 | 2011 - 2015 | **Mainstream Integration:** The Eurorack format sees widespread adoption across various music genres. Companies like Mutable Instruments, Intellijel, and 4ms contribute to the growing diversity of modules. The introduction of digital modules alongside analog expands the sonic potential of Eurorack. |
| 8 | 2016 | **Popularity Boom:** The rise of social media, online tutorials, and a growing community of modular enthusiasts help popularize Eurorack. More musicians and producers begin to integrate modular systems into their setups. |
| 9 | 2017-2019 | **Cultural Phenomenon:** Eurorack modular synthesis becomes a cultural movement, with dedicated events, festivals (like Superbooth), and an expanding global community. The DIY culture flourishes, with many users building their own modules. |
| 10 | 2020 - present | **Sustained Growth:** Despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Eurorack market continues to thrive. New companies emerge, and established brands push the boundaries of what modular synthesis can achieve. The format is now widely recognized as a powerful tool for music production, sound design, and live performance, solidifying its place in the electronic music landscape. |
