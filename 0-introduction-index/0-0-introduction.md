Welcome to the very first edition of "Eurorack Synthesizers for Dummies"!

Consider this your initial plunge into the exciting, and sometimes perplexing, world of modular synthesis.

We're starting you off with the foundational knowledge to get those cables connected and those oscillators humming.

Keep in mind, this is a living document.

Like the evolving nature of Eurorack itself, this manual will grow and adapt.

Expect future revisions, expansions, and clarifications as we learn more, receive your feedback, and refine our approach to making Eurorack as accessible as possible.

Think of this as version 1.0 â€“ a solid starting point, but just the beginning of a much larger journey.

So, dive in, don't be afraid to experiment, and get ready to make some noise!.
